Stock prediction using Python using the Pandas framework. we'll manipulate the data and attempt to come up with some sort of system for investing in companies,apply some machine learning, even some deep learning. To begin, we need a list of companies. In our case, we want a Python list of the S&P 500 companies. Whether you are looking for the Dow Jones companies, the S&P 500, or the Russell 3000. You will want to make sure it is up-to-date, In our case, we're going to grab the list from Wikipedia. The tickers/symbols in Wikipedia are organized on a table. To handle for this, we're going to use the HTML parsing library, Beautiful Soup.
